## About this project
This memory was game is built by **Julie Teeuwen**. It is the second project of the [UDACITY FRONTEND DEVELOPERS COURS](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The first project was to create a basic portfolio. Click [here](https://github.com/Julie2305/portfolio) to see her full portfolio.

## Game rules
This game is set up to play against yourself. When you click the first card, a clock will start ticking, so you can keep track of your fastes game. Also the amount of moves you need to finish the game will be displayed. After 13 moves you will lose one star. After 20 moves you will lose the second star, and after 27 moves you have no stars left. You can reset the game everytime when clicking the reset button. The timer and movecounter will be reset to 0 and you will start with three stars again. 

## Future features
There are some features that I would like to ad in the future. 
- Make it invisible to check the position of the cards in the DOM, so the player cannot cheat.
- Fill out your name and put your score up to a scoreboard
